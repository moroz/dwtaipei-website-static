    <p>
      Due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak in Mainland China,
      international travel is becoming increasingly difficult. Many of you have
      had your plane tickets canceled by airline companies and it is yet
      uncertain how serious the situation around the world could become by
      March. Therefore, Lama Ole has decided to{" "}
      <strong>cancel the Mahamudra Course</strong> in Taipei.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decision is best explained in Lama Ole's open letter, which follows:

    <h2 className="title has-text-centered">Lama Ole Nydahl's Open Letter</h2>
    <div className="open_letter">
      <p className="has-text-right">Irkutsk, February 3rd, 2020</p>
      <p>Dearest Diamond Way students and friends everywhere,</p>
      <p>
        In connection with calamities and wars, responsible people will always
        choose to save their assets. This is because timeless knowledge may
        easily be lost and accumulated wisdom may not reappear in a world of so
        many changes. For that reason, we, the Diamond Way practitioners and
        teachers must absolutely create the spaces for the knowledge of our
        lineages to survive and in every possible situation to revive this
        wisdom and again pass it on.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, with the heartbreaking disease hitting the world from China at
        present, it’s our job to do this. Most of us have practised for many
        years and are well educated to overview our present situation which has
        been increasingly worse.
      </p>
      <p>
        We, therefore – and with great pain towards you, who became our dharma
        family and close friends – cannot presently visit Vladivostok, Taipei
        and Glentui. Here, it’s our responsibility to preserve this living
        wisdom which we hold and which is the lifeblood of our lineage.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the course in Irkutsk, we will, therefore, use our time for
        preserving and passing on the teachings in Europe. It will hopefully be
        just for a short time and when the sky will again be free, we will be
        able to pass on these living transmissions under safe and responsible
        conditions worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        We deeply hope that you are all safe and please focus on our Diamond Way
        practices that you already enjoy. They are exceedingly meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>Look forward very much to seeing you soon again,</p>
      <p className="open_letter__signature">
        Yours from Irkutsk in Siberia, only with -25 degrees,
        <br />
        Lama Ole and friends.
