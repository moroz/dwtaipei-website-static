Buddhist meditation is a highly precise method for working with mind. It has the power to lift our perception to a beyond-personal level.
The Buddhist approach to meditation can be described as &ldquo;effortlessly staying in what there is&rdquo;.

Meditations at the center take place every Tuesday at 8pm. They are open for everyone and are free of charge. No prior knowledge about Buddhism and meditation is required, however if you have not meditated before, please come half an hour earlier so we can give you a short introduction.

Our main practice is the 16th Karmapa meditation, which has been given by the Tibetan master H.H. 16th&nbsp;Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, and translated into English by Lama Ole Nydahl.
