## Course Venue 📍

The course will take place at the **Tamsui Cultural Park** in Tamsui
District, New Taipei City, Taiwan. The venue is situated directly at the
Tamsui River ([淡水河]{lang="zh-Hant"}), with a good view of Mount
Guanyin, named after Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, and the Taiwan Strait,
separating Taiwan from China. There are plenty of restaurants, cafés,
hotels, and hostels in walking distance, and the Tamsui District is in
itself a popular tourist destination.

Address in Chinese:\

## Before you board the plane 🛫

Taiwan offers visa-free entry for citizens of most developed countries.
**Please check the precise requirements for Visa-Exempt Entry at the
website of [the Bureau of Consular Affairs,
MoFA](https://www.boca.gov.tw/cp-149-4486-7785a-2.html).** If you are
not eligible for Visa-Exempt Entry, you have to apply for a tourist visa
with the local representative office of Taiwan. You will not be allowed
to board the plane without all the required documents. We cannot and
will not send visa invitation letters to anyone.

The requirements for Chinese nationals are likely to be more strict. If
you are a Chinese national living abroad, it may be easier for you to
apply for an Entry Permit ([入台證]{lang="zh-Hant"}) in your country of
residence.

Due to the recent outbreaks of the African Swine Fever, it is strictly
forbidden to bring any meat products into Taiwan. Any organic products
brought into Taiwan, such as flowers, soil, or fresh vegetables, have to
be declared. At the airport, custom officers with a cute little beagle
dog will come by to smell your luggage, and if they discover any
undeclared meat products, you will be fined **NT\$1,000,000** (approx.
28,500€).

## After landing 🛬

The main airport in Taiwan is known as the **Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport** (IATA: TPE) and is located in Taoyuan City, to
the south of Taipei. You can easily get to downtown Taipei with the
**Airport MRT** ([機場捷運]{lang="zh-Hant"}), which takes 38 minutes to
get to Taipei Main Station. You can easily get by with single tickets,
but in general it's cheaper and more convenient to buy an _EasyCard_
([悠遊卡]{lang="zh-Hant"}), available at all ticket booths and ticketing
machines for NT\$100 (approx. 3€). You can recharge your card at all
convenience stores and MRT stations, and also use it to pay for buses,
local trains, taxis, or for your shopping at supermarkets and
convenience stores.

### Staying online 📟

After you arrive, you may want to purchase a temporary SIM card, as
these are not sold anywhere in downtown Taipei. A card valid for 5 days
costs around NT\$450 (approx. 13€) and will provide you with unlimited
data transfer. You will need to show your passport at the counter.

### Exchanging currencies 💱

It is possible to exchange foreign currencies (see: [foreign exchange
rates, Bank of Taiwan](https://rate.bot.com.tw/xrt?Lang=en-US)) in
Taipei, but you're probably better off doing so at the airport, as most
banks are only open until 3:30 PM. You will have to show your passport
and a small commission will be deducted. You can also withdraw money in
New Taiwan Dollars (TWD) at most ATMs throughout Taiwan. There are
several ATMs at each station of the Taipei MRT, operated by the Cathay
United Bank, and they all accept foreign cards.

## Getting around 🚇

The fastest way to get around Taipei is using the **Taipei Metro
system** (also called MRT---short for **M**ass **R**ail **T**ransit),
which covers most of Taipei City and a large part of New Taipei City.
Other means of transport include public buses and a system of rental
bicycles called YouBike. In order to rent a YouBike, you will need to
register using your EasyCard and a Taiwanese mobile phone number (the
SIM cards purchased at the airport are fine). The rental fee will be
deducted directly from your EasyCard.

Taxis and Uber are safe, cheap, and comfortable, but may not be the
fastest way to get around if there is a lot of traffic. Most drivers are
honest and drive with the meter, but very few of them speak English, so
you will need to show them the address of your destination written in
Chinese.

## Accomodation 🏨

There are plenty of hostels, guesthouses, and hotels all around Taipei.
Unlike Hong Kong or Japan, Taiwan is not exactly short on space, so you
can get very reasonably priced accomodation---for as little as NT\$2500
for a double room in a four-star hotel. You can book accomodation using
popular booking websites, such as
[Booking.com](https://www.booking.com),
[HostelWorld](https://www.hostelworld.com), or
[Agoda](https://www.agoda.com).

During the course, you will probably like to stay somewhere along the
red line of the MRT. The Tamsui station is quite a long way from the
city center. If you want to stay somewhere more convenient, you can look
for accomodation near Shilin ([士林]{lang="zh-Hant"}), Jiantan
([劍潭]{lang="zh-Hant"}), or Beitou ([北投]{lang="zh-Hant"}) stations.
All of these places are also good starting points for trips to the
Yangmingshan National Park ([陽明山國家公園]{lang="zh-Hant"}).

## Staying safe 👮

With regard to crime, Taiwan is a relatively safe place. In many places,
people leave their bicycles unlocked. It is very rare for tourists to be
mugged or robbed, and if you happen to forget your iPhone in a public
place, chances are you can still find it. That being said, you should
still take proper care of your belongings.

Road traffic in Taiwan is wild and can be shocking to first-time
visitors. The most popular means of transport are scooters and
motorcycles. Their users tend to squeeze between cars and buses, making
driving particularly difficult and stressful. Although it is possible to
rent a car with an International Driving Permit if you register your
documents with the police, we do not recommend driving around Taiwan\'s
cities, particularly the Taipei Metropolitan Area, Taichung, and
Kaohsiung.
